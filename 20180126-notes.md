Notes on analysis for Sean Anderson on 1/26/2018

All actual variables names are in **bold**

Workflow plan:

*Question 1 -- best simple bivariate models?*

-   Checking the following predictors (different satellite indices of
    burn severity):

    -   **dNBR: normalized burn ratio (diff between pre and post image)
        affected a lot by abs. change**

    -   **dNBR\_BL: bilinear interpolation across neighboring cells vs.
        focal pixel**

    -   **dNBR\_Offest: standardizes for nearby regional effects by
        offsetting by nearby image**

    -   **dNBR\_Offset\_BL**

    -   **RdNBR: relative... (trying to fix dNBR... commonly used but
        complicated)**

    -   **RdNBR\_BL**

    -   **RBR: relative burn ratio, simple intuitive ratio of change**

    -   **RBR\_BL**

-   *Could exclude BL and offset if not better*

-   With the following responses:

    -   **Firemort.BA.p** (BA killed proportion)

    -   **Firemort.trees.p** (Trees killed proportion)

    -   **CHARHT\_percMax** (Char height as proportion of tree height)

    -   **BOLESCORCH** (Bole scorch proportion)

    -   **CHARCOV** (Charred surface proportion)

*Question 2 -- can we improve with easily available GIS data?*

-   Running through the following...

    -   Building the best model with these easily available additional
        predictor variables, with the goal of making the best
        generalizable model of burn severity for the US Rockies

        -   **lat**

        -   **HeatLoad**

        -   **slope**

        -   **preNBR**

*Question 3 -- How are the "best" models affected by important
characteristics of stand structure, that are NOT easily attainable*.

-   Then once that best generalizable model is created, asking which of
    these interactions affects the relationship between field and
    satellite burn severity

    -   **QMD\_LAF quadratic mean diameter of trees at time of fire**

    -   **QMD\_all** [[]{#OLE_LINK2 .anchor}]{#OLE_LINK1
        .anchor}**quadratic mean diameter of trees (incl. dead before
        fire from insects etc.)**

    -   **ba\_ha basal area of trees per ha**

    -   **stems\_ha stems per ha**

    -   **RedGrayGreenStage.BA.p prop. Basal area in plot killed by bark
        beetle before fire**

I will attach a 'clean' csv file that is trimmed down to these variables
and possibly a few more.

The csv is called "RockiesBurnSev\_clean\_20180124"

Maps: raw, mean, credible high, credible low...
